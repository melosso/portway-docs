# Getting Started

> Install Portway and make your first authenticated API call.

Portway runs as an ASP.NET Core application behind IIS on Windows Server, or as a Docker container on any platform. This guide covers both paths through to a working endpoint.

## Prerequisites

**Windows Server / IIS:**
- Windows Server (or Windows 11 for development)
- [.NET 10 ASP.NET Core Hosting Bundle](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/10.0)
- Internet Information Services (IIS)

:::warning
Download the **Hosting Bundle**, not the x64 runtime installer. The Hosting Bundle includes the IIS integration module that the runtime package omits.
:::

**Docker:**
- Docker Engine with Compose support

A SQL database is only required if you plan to use SQL endpoints.

## Installation

### Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  portway:
    image: ghcr.io/melosso/portway:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - portway_app:/app
      - ./environments:/app/environments
      - ./endpoints:/app/endpoints
      - ./tokens:/app/tokens
      - ./log:/app/log
      - ./data:/app/data
    environment:
      - PORTWAY_ENCRYPTION_KEY=YourEncryptionKeyHere

volumes:
  portway_app:
```

Start the container:

```sh
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

Portway starts on port 8080. Adjust the port mapping and volume paths to suit your environment. For a full walkthrough with configuration options, see [Docker Installation](docker-compose.md).

### Windows Server (IIS)

:::info
This guide assumes working knowledge of IIS and your data sources. The steps cover the required configuration, some details will depend on your existing environment.
:::

Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/melosso/portway/releases/).

**1. Install the .NET 10 Hosting Bundle:**

```powershell
winget install --id Microsoft.DotNet.HostingBundle.10 -e
```

**2. Generate an encryption key:**

```powershell
$bytes = New-Object byte[] 48
[Security.Cryptography.RandomNumberGenerator]::Create().GetBytes($bytes)
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("PORTWAY_ENCRYPTION_KEY", [Convert]::ToBase64String($bytes), "Machine")
```

**3. Extract Portway to your IIS directory** (e.g. `C:\Portway`).

**4. Configure IIS:**

1. Open IIS Manager
2. Create a new Application Pool:
   - Name: `PortwayAppPool`
   - .NET CLR version: `No Managed Code`
   - Managed pipeline mode: `Integrated`
3. Create a TLS/SSL certificate or import an existing one
4. Create a new Website:
   - Application pool: `PortwayAppPool`
   - Physical path: `C:\Portway`
   - Binding: your preferred port and certificate
5. Set the Application Pool identity to a domain user with network access if you need NTLM pass-through for proxy endpoints

Portway is now accessible at the configured binding address.

## Initial configuration

### Retrieve your access token

On first run, Portway generates a token file at:

```
tokens/YOUR_SERVER_NAME.txt
```

The file contains your Bearer token:

```json
{
  "Username": "SERVER-NAME",
  "Token": "your-bearer-token-here",
  "AllowedScopes": "*",
  "AllowedEnvironments": "*",
  "ExpiresAt": "Never",
  "CreatedAt": "2025-01-01 00:00:00"
}
```

:::warning
This file contains a plaintext secret. Remove it from disk immediately after recording the token. Unauthorized access to this file compromises your gateway.
:::

### Configure environments

Create `environments/settings.json` to define which environments are active:

```json
{
  "Environment": {
    "ServerName": "localhost",
    "AllowedEnvironments": ["dev", "test", "prod"]
  }
}
```

Then create a folder and `settings.json` for each environment:

```
environments/
  ├── settings.json
  ├── dev/
  │   └── settings.json
  ├── test/
  │   └── settings.json
  └── prod/
      └── settings.json
```

Example `environments/prod/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "ServerName": "SQLSERVER01",
  "ConnectionString": "Server=SQLSERVER01;Database=ProductionDB;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=true;",
  "Headers": {
    "Origin": "Portway"
  }
}
```

### Create your first endpoint

Create `endpoints/SQL/Products/entity.json`:

```json
{
  "DatabaseObjectName": "Products",
  "DatabaseSchema": "dbo",
  "PrimaryKey": "ProductId",
  "AllowedColumns": [
    "ProductId",
    "ProductName",
    "Price",
    "Stock"
  ],
  "AllowedEnvironments": ["dev", "test", "prod"]
}
```

Portway detects the new file and loads it without restarting.

### Test your API

Open the OpenAPI UI at `https://localhost/docs`, authorize with your Bearer token, and make your first call:

```http
GET /api/prod/Products
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```
